\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would first like to thank my thesis advisor Dr. Armin Gerl for the competent, patient and collegiate supervision. Without the valuable feedback, consultations and advice, a project of this magnitude was infeasible.
Furthermore many thanks to M. Sc. Sebastian Wilhelm for providing a valuable basis for the measurement processes, and granting the full access and permission for modifications. Also infrequent troubleshoots were very much appreciated.
Lastly many thanks to both parties that facilitate the project "Energy++" the University of Passau, represented by the head of the initiating chair of distributed information systems, Prof. Dr Harald Kosch, and the invaluable cooperation of AtoS SE, namely represented by CEO Mr. Roland Wossidlo. The physical and theoretical contributions were greatly appreciated.

Thank you so much.
