	abstract = { This paper presents a study of the runtime, memory usage and energy consumption of twenty seven well-known software languages. We monitor the performance of such languages using ten different programming problems, expressed in each of the languages. Our results show interesting findings, such as, slower/faster languages consuming less/more energy, and how memory usage influences energy consumption. Finally, we show how to use our results to provide software engineers support to decide which language to use when energy efficiency is a concern. },

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to quantify the total amount of energy consumption and CO2 emission caused by the construction, operation, maintenance, and renovation of office buildings in Japan. In order to quantify the life cycle energy consumption and CO2 emission of a building, it is necessary to obtain an estimate of the total quantity of domestic products and services used directly or indirectly (including the repercussion effect of the economy) during the life cycle of the building. The Input/Output (I/O) Table of Japan is used to calculate the total domestic product and then energy consumption and CO2 emission are estimated by using energy consumption and CO2 emission data for unit production of various categories of industries.}

	abstract="Due to the increasing spread of smart meters, numerous researchers are currently working on disaggregating the power consumption data. This procedure is commonly known as Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM). However, most approaches to energy disaggregation first require a labeled dataset to train these algorithms. In this paper, we present a new labeled power consumption dataset that was collected in 20 private households in Germany between September 2019 and July 2020. For this purpose, the total power consumption of each household was measured with a commercial available smart meter and the individual consumption data of 10 selected household appliances were collected.Wilhelm, SebastianJakob, DietmarKasbauer, JakobAhren, Diane",
